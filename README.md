# Pgswitcher

Postgresql Proxy for switch server

## Why do we build this?

When we migrate our database from your own 
Postgres server into Cloud Postgres Server or
the other way around, we ussually have a long 
downtime. The downtime is caused by manually
do these task:

- turn off the app (if app are cluster then need to
  turn of all of app in the cluster)
- waiting unitl there is no connection to database
- execute some script to set the sequence for the table
- change the config the url in app that point into new database
- turn up the database

*pgswitcher* will act as proxy so we can execute 
all of the task automatically, by providing proxy for 
the postgresql database.

## Getting Started

You can see the example of how it works by see 
[pgswitcher_test](https://github.com/egon12/pgswitcher/tree/main/pgswitcher_test)

# Warning

This project is still in early development stage
So it still unstable aspect like the proxy doesn't support
cancel request with pid and secret key.

Use it carefully
